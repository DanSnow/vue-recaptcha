## What is "ReCAPTCHA couldn't find user-provided function: `__vueRecaptchaLoaded`"?
It's because google's recaptcha have been loaded before your app. You can simply ignore it because vue-recaptcha can still detect and render recaptcha. If you care about this, try to move the script tag of recatpcha after to your app.

## How to test vue-recaptcha?
You can mock `window.grecaptcha` to bypass google's recaptcha.

## How about an e2e testing (or integration testing)?
Please reference to [recaptcha's FAQ](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/faq#id-like-to-run-automated-tests-with-recaptcha.-what-should-i-do).
